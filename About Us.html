<p>Trandon Associates, Inc. is known for it's excellence and professionalism in working with both our clients, as well as our candidates.  Our dynamic team of staffing specialists utilizes a wide variety of resources to find the highest quality of candidates for each specific position we have available.  We take the time to meet with each candidate individually to evaluate their backgrounds, qualifications, and career goals and interests.</p>
 
<p>Once the candidate has been presented to a client, we take the appropriate measures to screen these individuals to make sure they are suitable, according to what our clients desire; this includes background and reference checks at the clientsâ€™ requests.  Once the client expresses an interest in the individual, the candidate is presented with a full company and job description in order to prepare them for their interview.  At that point, the company has the option to either hire the individual, or continue the interview process.</p>
 
<p>Our goal is to please both the client, as well as the candidate, forming lasting professional relationships on both ends.  We pride ourselves in knowing that we work to our highest ability to provide satisfaction at all times for both parties, and will do our best to do so.</p>
